# 🏦 Project: Credit Scoring Using Boosting Models

## 📄 Project Description

In this project, I developed a credit scoring model using boosting algorithms such as Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Credit scoring is a system used by financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of clients. The main objective of this project was to build a model that accurately predicts the likelihood of a client defaulting on their loan based on their financial data.

## 🛠 Technologies and Tools

The following technologies and tools were used in this project:

- **Python** — Primary programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook** — For data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas, NumPy** — For data processing and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn** — For data preprocessing and model training.
- **XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost** — Boosting models for building and optimizing the credit scoring model.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** — For data visualization and result interpretation.

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Datasets were sourced from open data repositories, including financial information, credit history of clients.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Checking for missing values.
   - Coding of categorical variables.
   - Scaling of numerical features.
   - Splitting data into training and test sets.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Training models using Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Using metrics like AUC-ROC, F1-score, Precision, and Recall to evaluate model performance.

5. **Model Comparison**:
   - Comparing the performance of different boosting models.
   - Selecting the best model for deployment.

## 📈 Results

- The **CatBoost** model achieved the highest AUC-ROC and F1-score on the test data, making it the best-performing model.
